# pdf-to-sqlite-parser

Modular Python utility to parse structured data from PDFs and write results to a SQLite database. Built with PyMuPDF and regex-based metadata extraction.

This project provides a lightweight, scalable foundation for parsing tabular and metadata content from documents like school reports, invoices, or assessments. It’s designed for clarity and extensibility — ideal as a starting point for building more advanced data extraction pipelines.

## 📄 What It Does

- Iterates through a folder of PDF reports
- Extracts page-level metadata using regex
- Parses embedded tables using `PyMuPDF`
- Outputs structured rows to a local SQLite database
- Designed for high-volume, unattended execution

## 📁 File Structure

| File              | Purpose                                                  |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `pdf_extractor.py` | Main script for parsing PDFs and writing to SQLite       |
| `state_db/`        | Folder containing source PDFs and the generated DB file  |
| `school_reports.db`| SQLite database storing extracted data (autogenerated)   |

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- **PyMuPDF** – PDF parsing and layout-aware table extraction
- **SQLite3** – Local database for structured storage
- **Regex** – For extracting names, dates, and report details
- **Pathlib / Logging** – Clean I/O handling and debug tracing

## 🚀 Example Use Case

> A school administrator needs to extract student names, semester reports, and subject-level grades from 200+ PDFs for analytics.

This script will:
1. Loop through the reports in a folder  
2. Extract student info (name, year, report type)  
3. Parse a table of subjects and scores  
4. Write all entries to a SQLite DB  
5. Be ready for export to CSV or dashboard tools

## 🧩 Notes

- This project is intentionally simple and modular — ideal for adapting to new layouts or workflows.
- Error handling is included to skip malformed or partial files without halting execution.
- Can be extended to support CSV export, API submission, or cloud-based scheduling.
